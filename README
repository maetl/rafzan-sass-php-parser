*** SNOT WORKING PROPERLY YET ***

An unobstrusive SASS compiler/parser for PHP projects.

All of the magic happens in .htaccess!!
So, ensure that your server have mod_rewrite enabled.

If you want to mix .sass and .css files, don't worry.
Sass handler will only compile and re-route .sass files.

This script is using pHAMLp libraries, so, it will compile,
cache, compress and route your CSS code for extra speed and
less resource consumption.


Installation:

Just use this directory as your default assets, sass or css dir.
For a better organization, you can change the routing at .htaccess
and paste /lib on your /libraries directory.


Usage:

if you have a /src/file.sass, you should look for it on /src/file.css.
If file.css don't exist, sass handler will compile it for you. If there
is a file /src/file.css, sass handler will NOT compile anything and will
be using the existing file.css.

You can also look for /src/file.sass - any HTTP method directing to this
file will result in an compiled css version of it.
